	<h3>Triads Play</h3>
	<p>
		You‚Äôre given 9 words or phrases called ‚Äúcues.‚Äù Find 3 that share a common key, to form a 3-part Triad. A Triad‚Äôs key is a single stand-alone word
		uniquely shared by the 3 cues. Solve all three Triads and win the game ‚Äì proof of your lateral thinking skills!
	</p>
	<p>
		Here‚Äôs an example. These cues would appear as part of a set of nine.<br />
		<b>SECOND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POKER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SHAKE</b><br />
		Linked with the key <b>HAND</b>, we get <b>SECOND-HAND</b>, <b>POKER HAND</b>, and <b>HANDSHAKE</b>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cues can be compound or hyphenated words, sometimes even famous names, places, and everyday phrases. Keys (solutions) are always one word only. Some are
		easy, some not. Take your time.
	</p>
	<h3>Hints and Misses</h3>
	<p>You have three guesses and two hints (optional). Miss a guess, use a turn. Take a hint, use a turn.</p>
	<p><span class="tries">‚ñ≥</span> = turns remaining, üõü = get a hint</p>
	<p>With 9 or 6 cues shown, a hint highlights a Triad. When 3 cues remain a hint shows the key‚Äôs first letter.</p>
	<h3>Scoring</h3>
	<p>Every Triad game is scored, tallied, and averaged for you, using this point system.</p>
	<table>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Outcome</td>
				<td>Points</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A perfect score. No misses, no hints</td>
				<td>10</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Success, but with either 1 miss or 1 hint</td>
				<td>8</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Success, with 2 misses and/or hints</td>
				<td>6</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Got 2 out of 3, just couldn‚Äôt get that last one</td>
				<td>4</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Got 1 Triad but couldn‚Äôt get the other 2</td>
				<td>2</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Went down in flames. No success at all</td>
				<td>0</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
