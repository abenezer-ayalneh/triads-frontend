## 📖 About

Triads is a single-player, untimed word puzzle game where you identify a single keyword that links three different cue words to form a **Triad**. Once you solve three initial Triads, the three keywords become your final challenge—solve all four Triads to win!

The game features beautiful physics-based bubble animations, smooth gameplay, and comprehensive statistics tracking—all without requiring any login or personal information.

## 🎮 How to Play

### The Basics

You're given **9 bubbles** containing words or phrases called **cues**. Your goal is to find **3 cues** that share a common **key word** to form a **3-word Triad**. a key is always a stand-alone word uniquely shared by the 3 cues.

**Example:** `SECOND-`, `POKER`, `SHAKE` → The key word is **"HAND"**, completing:

- SECOND-**HAND**
- POKER **HAND**
- **HAND**SHAKE

### Game Flow

1. **Initial State**: Start with 9 cue words in floating bubbles
2. **Find a Triad**: Select three cues that share a common keyword
3. **Solve the Triad**: Enter your guess for the keyword
4. **Repeat**: Solve a second and third Triad
5. **Final Challenge**: The three keywords from the first three Triads become new cues for the final, fourth Triad
6. **Win**: Solve all four Triads to win the game!

### Hints and Turns

- **3 turns** and **2 hints** available (any combination)
- **Miss a guess** = lose a turn
- **Take a hint** = lose a turn

**Hint Types:**

- **When 9 or 6 cues remain**: Highlights a Triad and shows the keyword length
- **When 3 cues remain**: Also shows the keyword's first letter
