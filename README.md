# Triads

Triads is a word puzzle game where you identify a single keyword that links three different cue words to form a Triad, and then use those keywords to solve a final Triad.

## How to Play

You’re given 9 bubbles that contain words or phrases called cues. Find 3 that share a common key word to form a 3-word Triad. A key is a stand-alone word uniquely shared by the 3 cues.

Here’s an example: `SECOND-`, `POKER`, `SHAKE`. The key word is “HAND,” completing SECOND-HAND, POKER HAND, and HANDSHAKE.

Once you've solved all 3 Triads, or "cleared the board," the 3 key words become your final Triad to solve. That's your goal: figure out all four of the Triads, and win the game.

Cues can be compound or hyphenated words or phrases, and sometimes even famous names, places, or everyday phrases. Keys (solutions) are always one word. Some are easy, some not. Take your time.

### Hints and Misses

You have three guesses and two hints, any combination. Miss a guess, lose a turn. Take a hint, lose a turn. When 9 or 6 cues are showing, a hint highlights a Triad for you and shows how many letters are in the key. When only 3 cues remain, a hint also shows the key’s first letter.

## Scoring

Every game is scored, tallied, and averaged for you, using this scoring system.
